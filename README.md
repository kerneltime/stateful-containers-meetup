# Speaking at a meetup

A speaker is responsible for

1. Providing the description of the topic in advance (1 week min)
2. Providing a writeup of the talk, post talk. (PR with content in markdown and optionally attaching a PDF)
3. Accepting questions (via issues) for the covered talk

The primary motivation for the write up is to insure that the content is made available in a format that is readable post talk and searchable for members of the community.
